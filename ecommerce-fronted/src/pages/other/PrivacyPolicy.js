                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>Inani Application (the "Application") values the privacy of individuals we interact with,
                    especially their personal information. </p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy describes the personal information that Inani collects from or about you and
                    how we use and disclose that information from users of the Application</p>
                <p>We use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the Application. Using the
                    Application, you agree to the collection and use of information under this policy</p>
                <h3>Information Collection </h3>
                <p>While using our Application, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable
                    information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may
                    include but is not limited to your name ("Personal Information"). This includes personal
                    information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Profile information such as your username, password, and picture.</li>
                    <li>Contact information </li>
                    <li>Some financial information as account numbers, payment card information, and related details</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We will collect information that you provide to us when you use the Services, such as when you
                    create an account, make a purchase, send questions or comments via the Service, email, or chat
                    to Inani or other users; fill out surveys; or otherwise communicate with other users or us through
                    or about the Services.</p>
                <p>We will also collect information when you sign up for marketing emails, events, or other
                    opportunities through Inani. </p>
                <p>Inani uses various technologies to collect information, including cookies, web beacons, location
                    identifiers, and the like. We also use the information to improve our Services, including for
                    analytics purposes. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate,
                    analyze, improve, and optimize our website and Service. We may collect information from you,
                    as further described herein. Aggregated, non-personally identifying information is not your Information.</p>
                <h3>Legal Basis for the Collection of Your Personal Information</h3>
                <p>Inani collects and processes your information based on different legal grounds, depending on the
                    nature of the information being provided and the type of processing involved, as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Performance of a Contract. Some of the Information processed by Inani is performed
                        because it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you or to take steps at the
                        user's request before entering such an agreement.</li>
                    <li>Legitimate Interest. A second ground relied upon by Inani for other types of processing
                        of your Personal Information is that it is necessary for legitimate interests pursued by Inani. Such
                        legitimate  interests  will include where Inani sends you marketing about our products and
                        services, where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular
                        type of processing on your behalf, or where such processing is strictly necessary for fraud
                        detection and prevention. Inani will only rely on such a ground where an assessment has been
                        performed, balancing the interests and rights involved and the necessity of the processing to
                        provide our services, products, and features to you.</li>
                    <li>A Legal Obligation. The third ground for certain types of processing is that it is necessary
                        to allow Inani to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                    <li>Consent. Finally, in certain situations, Inani relies on your consent to process your
                        Personal Data, such as marketing communications.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Sharing Your information</h3>

                        information with our channel partners, subsidiaries, affiliates, professional advisors (such as

                    <li>Third Parties. Suppose you enable features or functionality that connect the Service to a third party platform such as a social media network (each, a "Third Party").
