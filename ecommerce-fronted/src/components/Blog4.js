            freelancing is a great way to earn income as it allows you to apply
            what you already know to make extra money. The best part about
            freelancing is the flexibility compared to your 9-5 job.

            channel.

            for simply posting and sharing. Platforms such as Facebook, Youtube,
            and Tiktok allow you to monetize your content. In addition, if your
            online presence is large enough, many brands work with influencers
            to promote their products and enhance their brand. A common way for
            influencers to earn is through these sponsorships.

            online resource. Many companies now look for stock music and
            photos/videos for their websites or ads. In their spare time, those
            who do so can share their creations with Shutterstock or Bensound to
            make some money.
          </p>
